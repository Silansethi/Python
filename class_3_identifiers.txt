Identifiers:-
-----------

A name in python program is called identifiers.
It can be class name, variable name, function name or module name.

variable = data


Rules to define identifiers in python:-
------------------------------------

1.The only allowed charcters in python are

 > alphabets(upper case and lower case).
 > digits (0 to 9).
 > special symbol(under score _ )

2. Identifiets should not start with digit.

	>>>> Ajhj = 10
>>> ghA_ = 10
>>> _cgue67 = 10
>>> 67hg = 78
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

3. Identifiers are case sensitive , Of course python language is case sensitive language.

>>> total = 99
>>> total
99
>>> Total
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#8>", line 1, in <module>
    Total
NameError: name 'Total' is not defined
----------------------------

PEP8:- Python Enterprise Proposal 

Writing code with proper logic is a key factor of programming, it is the guidless and format how to write coding style make code much reliable.


Camel Casing:-( ClassName and ModuleName and FolderName)

Use Area :- Uppercase, Lowercase and digit

1.Everyword first char. should be upper and rest are lower.

Ex:- State Bank Of India

>>>>>> StateBankOfIndia100927



Snake Casing:- (variable_name,function_name,file_name)

Use Area :- Lowercase and digit and underscore(_)

1.Everychar of snake casing is lower and we will use  _ symbol between the two words.

Ex:- State Bank Of India

>>>>>> state_bank_of_india_100927


What is Data?

Collection of meaning full information is called data.

What is variable?

variable store the data in python or any other language also.

ex:-

 a = 10


a---> normal variable
_a ---> Protected variable

__a ---> Private variable
